    "# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a text classification problem in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The task is to classify tweets on Twitter to determine whether a tweet is actually about a real disaster or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a binary classification problem, where the model needs to learn how to understand the context and meaning of text to make accurate decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Build an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model capable of:\n",
    "- Understanding the context and meaning of tweet text\n",
    "- Accurately distinguishing between tweets about real disasters and unrelated tweets\n",
    "- Achieving good accuracy on the test dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Learning**: RNN (LSTM/GRU) for processing sequential data\n",
    "- **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, or other text processing libraries\n",
    "- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metric**: F1-score (commonly used in imbalanced classification problems)\n",

    "### Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is divided into 3 main files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **train.csv**: Training data\n",
    "   - **Size**: Approximately 8,561 samples\n",
    "   - **Columns**:\n",
    "     - `id`: Unique identifier for each tweet\n",
    "     - `keyword`: Disaster-related keyword (may have null values)\n",
    "     - `location`: Geographic location (may have null values)\n",
    "     - `text`: Tweet content (text to be classified)\n",
    "     - `target`: Classification label (0 = not a disaster, 1 = real disaster)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **test.csv**: Test data\n",
    "   - **Size**: Approximately 3,699 samples\n",
    "   - **Columns**: Similar to train.csv but without the `target` column\n",
    "   - Purpose: Predict labels for tweets in the test set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Type**: Short text (tweets) - typically limited length (maximum 280 characters for Twitter)\n",
    "- **Language**: English\n",
    "- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)\n",

    "### Label Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data contains two classes:\n",
    "- **Class 0**: Tweet not about a real disaster\n",
    "- **Class 1**: Tweet about a real disaster"

    "\n",
    "1. **Missing Data**: Need to handle null values in `keyword` and `location`\n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning hashtags, URLs, mentions, special characters\n",
    "3. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into appropriate tokens\n",
    "4. **Sequence Padding**: Normalizing sequence lengths to fit RNN input requirements\n",
    "5. **Word Embedding**: Converting words into numerical vectors\n"
